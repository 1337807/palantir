palantir
========
Palantir is a project to detect and analyze changes in images over time.

Given an image with relatively slow and consistent changes (lighting, shadows) palantir will eventually be able to build up a corpus of data that allows it to detect anomalies in new images.

Paired with the all_seeing_pi gem this project can be used to build a crude security system.
